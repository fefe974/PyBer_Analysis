# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we will be analyzing data from PyBer and creating a summary about rides in different city 
types (Rural, Urban, Suburban). By using Matplotlib and Pandas, we will be making a multiline graph to 
gain insight into the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

In this project, we will be analyzing data from PyBer and creating a summary about rides in different city 
types (Rural, Urban, Suburban). By using Matplotlib and Pandas, we will be creating a multiline graph to 
gain insight into the total weekly fares for each city type.

Suburban follows behind urban type with 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, and $19,356.33 in total fare. In 3rd
came the Rural type with 125 total rides,  78 drivers, and $4,327.93. Seeing the average fare per driver, we can see
$34.62(rural type), $30.97(suburban-type) and, $24.53(urban-type).

## Summary 

Based on the numbers, we can increase the total rides in the rural areas by decreasing the fare price; by doing this
we could see an increase in the total rides in this city type and at the same time an increment of drivers in this area.
We could use the suburban fare prices to increase our rural numbers and make them similar to the suburban 
totals. With this, we should see an increase in profits and have a more balanced income stream in all city types.
